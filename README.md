A product review of a SanDisk SSD USB storage device: [SanDisk 2TB Extreme Portable External SSD - Up to 550MB/s - USB-C, USB 3.1 - SDSSDE60-2T00-G25](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078T9SZ3K).

A simple speed test, comparing the SanDisk to the SSD in my XPS 13 and to a old USB drive that I had in my desk.

The SanDisk was over 3 times faster than the Samsumg SSD. 

See the notebook [ssd-test](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/def-mycroft/usb-drive-test/blob/master/ssd-test.ipynb) to view the results.
